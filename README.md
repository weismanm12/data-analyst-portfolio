# Data Analyst Portfolio

## Introduction

Hello!

I'm Matthew Weisman and this is my data analysis project portfolio.

Within this portfolio, you'll find links to my completed data analysis projects, each showcasing a range of analytical skills. From data cleaning and validation to data wrangling, database development, exploratory analysis, statistical analysis, data visualization, and dashboarding, these projects encompass a wide array of data-related tasks.

To complete these projects, I used a variety of tools and software. For database work, I utilized SQL code (PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLAlchemy) to create and analyze databases, as well as to generate reports. Additionally, I used Python to complete tasks involving data cleaning, transformation, analysis, and visualization. I also leveraged Power BI to craft interactive dashboards.

Below, you'll find summaries of each project, along with links to their respective repositories for further exploration.

Thank you for visiting, and I hope you find my data analysis journey intriguing!

## Projects

### [Personal Finance Database and Dashboard](https://github.com/weismanm12/finances-database)
In this project, I developed a MySQL database to keep track of all my financial data and enable analysis, along with a Power BI dashboard to visualize spending trends. I extracted all transactions from my bank website and developed custom Python scrips to automate the bulk of the ETL process, allowing for easy maintenance of the database. SQL views were also created to act as reports to track KPIs such as monthly spending, spending by category, and changes in account balances. Additionally, the dashboard was linked directly to the MySQL database, providing valueable up to date insights in a visual manner.
