# Data Analyst Portfolio

## Introduction

Hello!

I'm Matthew Weisman and this is my data analysis project portfolio.

Within this portfolio, you'll find links to my completed data analysis projects, each showcasing a range of analytical skills. From data cleaning and validation to data wrangling, database development, exploratory analysis, statistical analysis, data visualization, and dashboarding, these projects encompass a wide array of data-related tasks.

To complete these projects, I used a variety of tools and softwares. For database work, I utilized SQL code (PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLAlchemy) to create, analyze databases, and generate reports. Additionally, I used Python to complete tasks involving data  cleaning, transformation, analysis, and visualization. I also leveraged Power BI to craft interactive dashboards.

Below, you'll find summaries of each project, along with links to their respective repositories for further exploration.

Thank you for visiting, and I hope you find my data analysis journey intriguing!
