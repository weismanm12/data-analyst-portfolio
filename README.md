# Data Analytics Portfolio

## Introduction

My name is Matthew Weisman and welcome to my data analytics porfolio.

Within this portfolio, you'll find links to my completed data analysis projects, each showcasing a range of analytical skills. From data cleaning and validation to data wrangling, database development, exploratory analysis, statistical analysis, data visualization, and dashboarding, these projects encompass a wide array of data-related tasks.

To complete these projects, I used a variety of tools and software. For database work, I utilized SQL code (PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLAlchemy) to create and analyze databases, as well as to generate reports. Additionally, I used Python to complete tasks involving data cleaning, transformation, analysis, and visualization. I also leveraged Power BI to craft interactive dashboards.

Below, you'll find summaries of each project, along with links to their respective repositories for further exploration.

Thank you for visiting, and I hope you find my data analysis journey intriguing!

## About Me

As an aspiring data analyst, I have a strong passion for working with data. During my college years at the University of Dayton, where I majored in Accounting with a minor in Management Information Systems, I discovered my interest in data analysis while completing internships in corporate and public accounting. I spent a great deal of time in these internships performing financial analysis, which led me to discover that what I enjoyed most was working hands-on with data, using it to find insight and answer business questions. This experience led me to explore the world of analytics and pursue more advanced analysis skills.

Through a combination of formal education, work experience, and online learning, I have gained knowledge in tools such as SQL, Python, Power BI, Tableau, and Excel. I have practical experience with SQL (MySQL, PostgreSQL) and Python (NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib/Seaborn) for seamless data manipulation, analysis, and visualization. Additionally, I am proficient in creating dashboards using Power BI and Tableau, along with conducting smaller-scale analyses in Excel. I also hold a [Data Analyst Associate certification from DataCamp](https://app.datacamp.com/certification), which validated my skills and knowledge. Besides my technical expertise, I have effectively communicated my analytical findings to business stakeholders through formal presentations. 

My primary aim is to leverage these analytical skills to uncover valuable insights and make a meaningful impact at a company through data analysis. For employment inquires, feel free to connect with me on LinkedIn[www.linkedin.com/in/matthewweisman2022

## Projects

### [Personal Finance Database and Dashboard](https://github.com/weismanm12/finances-database)

In this project, I developed a MySQL database to keep track of all my financial data and enable analysis, along with a Power BI dashboard to visualize spending trends. I extracted all transactions from my bank website and developed custom Python scrips to automate the bulk of the ETL process, allowing for easy maintenance of the database. SQL views were also created to act as reports to track KPIs such as monthly spending, spending by category, and changes in account balances. Additionally, the dashboard was linked directly to the MySQL database, providing valueable up to date insights in a visual manner.

### Analyzing Movie Data With IMDb
This project involved processing and analyzing movie data from the popular online movie database, IMDb. I extracted the [public public IMDb datsets](https://developer.imdb.com/non-commercial-datasets/), cleaned and transformed this data via Python, then created a PostgreSQL database to store the data. I then performed analysis via a combination of SQL queries and Python code to find trends in movie production, audience reception, and actor likeness.
